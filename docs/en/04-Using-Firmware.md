# Firmware Concepts
## Amiibo
Is a device sell by Nintendo, normally in form of a figurine, but also there are cards, wrist straps and others.

Each amiibo have a NFC tag embedded on the figurine base. The NFC tag have some data pre-record at factory identifying the type of figurine and making each amiibo unique of others.  The main data of the amiibo are:

As stated by Nintendo Amiibo is singular and plural (https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/535485751635763200)

## Model Info
Is a number which describe the amiibo series, game series, character and character variation, this info cannot be changed after first programming.

## UID
Is the serial number of the figurine is also hardcoded at factory making each amiibo unique.

## Amiibo Data
This section of the data on the tag store the user modifiable information like the Owner and Nickname registration or savegame data.

## UUID
The term UUID is used on the mod scene to reference the UID send to the game by a amiibo emulator, as the game uses the UID to know if a amiibo was already used; if the emulator changes the UID, the emulated amiibo looks like a completely different amiibo to the game, allowing to use that amiibo again.

## key_retail.bin
It's a binary file containing Nintendo private keys to encrypt amiibo, is copyrighted material so you need provide a legal acquired one, you can dump it form a 3DS or Switch Console.

## .BIN file
The data of an amiibo can be dumped to a file, that binary dump of the original content of an amiibo is stored on a file with `.BIN` extension, that dumps are uploaded to the device for the Amiibo Emulator application or the AmiiboLink Emulator application.  You need to provide a legally acquired binary dump file.

## Thumbwheel slide dial switch
Is the micro switch at top of the device, is a device having three buttons in one, a central one, and two sides.  Rocking the micro switch to sides you push that "**side**" buttons.  Pushing the micro switch you push the "**middle**" button.

On this document pressing the sides of Thumbwheel is named "**side buttons**", pushing the Thumbwheel is called "**middle button**"; to navigate items on a menu you use the side buttons, to select an item you press middle button.

# Using the Firmware
The Pixl.js firmware Main Screen is divided on several Applications, each one can be run to execute some actions, the applications on main screen are:

# AmiiboLink
This application emulates an AmiiboLink (AmiLoop or omllbolink) device.

These devices are generic espruino boards sell on different forms, normally are Keychains drop shaped, but also there are some Puck or Sheika Slate shaped.

Almost all have a button and some LEDs as indicators and runs from CR2032 cell batteries or lipo cells.

All of them are controlled from phone applications via Bluetooth, also you can upload one or several .BIN amiibo files using the phone to the device.

Starting this application the details for current amiibo are shown.  If you are on sequential mode you can use the side buttons to walk through all the uploaded amiibo, in all modes, you can press the middle button to open the AmiiboLink APP config sub menu, the menu have this items:

|   |
| ------------ |
| Mode []<BR>Auto Random. []<BR>Compati. Mode []<BR>Tag Details<BR>[Main Menu] |
|   |

## Mode []
Shows the actual operation mode, when selected you can choose the mode of amiibo working, the available modes are:
- ### Randomize (Manual)
On the actual AmiiboLink device the current amiibo changes the UUID when you press the device button
- ### Randomize (Auto)
A new random UUID for the current amiibo is generated after each time a game read it.  Allowing to use the same amiibo multiple times on games with restrictions. You cannot change the active amiibo on this mode.
- ### Sequential mode
On this mode you can change the actual amiibo using the side buttons, rolling through all amiibo uploaded with the phone app. All uploaded .BIN files are stored on the 01.bin to 26.bin files at the /amiibolink/ folder.
- ### Read-write mode
The device use a "special" amiibo slot where only an amiibo can be used, the amiibo can be replaced by another .BIN file from the phone app. On the local storage this amiibo is saved with at the /amiibolink/99.bin file.

Changing the mode preserve the current selected amiibo, with exception of «Read-write mode».

## Compati. Mode []
Shows the emulation firmware mode, the supported values are V1, V2 and AmiLoop, there are several APPs each one designed for a AmiiboLink firmware version or to the AmiLoop protocol.  Using this setting you can match the emulation with the protocol needed by the APP you use on your phone.
## Tag Details
Return to amiibo details page
## [Main Menu]
Exit the AmiiboLink Emulator application.

## AmiiboLink Compatible Applications
So far the only two AmiiboLink/AmiLoop mode manager phone Apps are translated to English, they are "Umiibo" and "AmiLoop" this applications are compatible only with the AmiLoop Mode.

Other oddity is what the modes on applications do not correspond with the modes set up on the device.

| Umiibo APP | Pixl.js Emulation Mode |

# Card Emulator

This application can be used to emulate Mifare cards and NTAG series cards.

Mifare cards are commonly used for access control cards, and the device can fully emulate Mifare types of cards. Supported Mifare card types include:

* Mifare Mini
* Mifare 1K
* Mifare 2K
* Mifare 4K

NTAG series cards are commonly used for device identification. Supported NTAG card types include:

* NTAG 213
* NTAG 215
* NTAG 216

Currently, a total of 8 cards are supported, with the option for customizing the number of cards in the future.

> Note:<br/>
> The emulation function of the NTAG series is still in testing, and the functionality is not yet complete. It does not fully emulate > the features of NTAG125. <br/>
> Further improvements to this part of the functionality will continue.

Emulation can only be activated in this interface, and it will be deactivated if you leave this interface.

After disk formatting or the first entry into the card emulator, data will be initialized. This process may take a few seconds, so please be patient.


## Card Emulation

The interface of the card emulation page is as follows:

|   |
| ------------ |
| [01] de:ad:be:ef|
|  |
| <    Slot 01      >|
|  |
| MF 1K <08/04 00>  |
|   |

The interface is explained as follows:

* The first line: `01` is the card number, and `de:ad:be:ef` is the card ID.
* The second line: Slot 01 is the name of the current card, which can be freely set.
* The third line: `MF 1K` displays the card type. The type abbreviations are shown in the table below. `08` is the card's SAK, `04 00` is the card's ATQA. The last symbol indicates the writing mode. If it is marked as a disk, writing is allowed; otherwise, writing is not allowed.
